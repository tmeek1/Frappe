Only first syntax error (or other?) is reported and process stopped

No semi-colons needed or allowed

No access modifiers

Comments:  just /* .... */ style

Object-based (no inheritance, interfaces, enumerations, ... )

No primitive data types!  

No packages, no imports

One nice class to do all typical stuff --- class Tool

control structures:

   for loop
   
   if ( <bool> ) {
      <statements>
   }
   else {
      <statements>
   }

OR:

   if ( <bool> ) {
      <statements>
   }

No arrays---just ArrayList

Need String   (only way to get specific numbers into program---literals like
                "3.14" )

No static stuff, only instance stuff
