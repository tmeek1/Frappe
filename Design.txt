General Notes

For simplicity, all classes have to be listed in one file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CFG notation
-------------------------------------

Things in <  >  are variables.

-> means a rule.

When rules continue to multiple lines with no ->, is just wrapping because
page is too narrow to fit the single rule.

| means "or", and
  <a> -> <b> | <c>
is just an abbreviation for
  <a> -> <b>
  <a> -> <c>

It is somewhat non-standard, but we use // ..... to put in explanatory comments.

The idea of doing like
  <somethings> -> <something> | <something> <somethings>
to say "1 or more <something>"  occurs a lot in the grammar.

To avoid irritating "epsilon" things (in theory class epsilon is the empty string)
in the grammar, which are hard to
parse, we often need to explicitly do multiple rules to cover all the
options that epsilons introduce without actually having epsilons.

This grammar is given in a form that is appropriate for mechanical parsing,
in the sense that it uses no short-cuts like * (0 or more) or + (1 or more) or optional stuff.

To avoid making the grammar bigger in silly ways, sometimes we mandate things that Java doesn't,
like methods have to have at least one <statement> in their bodies

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the draft rules, with some explanatory notes following (note that uppercase
letters are used for tokens):
------------------------------------

<program> -> <classes>

<classes> -> <class> | <class> <classes>

<class> -> CLASS CLASSNAME LBRACE <members> RBRACE

<members> -> <member> | <member> <members>

<member> -> <staticField> |  <staticMethod> | <constructor> |
            <instanceField> | <instanceMethod>

<staticField> -> STATIC NAME |
                 STATIC NAME EQUALs <expression>

<staticMethod> -> STATIC NAME LPAREN RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE |
                  STATIC NAME LPAREN <params> RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE |

<instanceField> -> NAME

<constructor> -> CLASSNAME LPAREN RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE
                 CLASSNAME LPAREN <params> RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE

<instanceMethod> -> NAME LPAREN RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE |
            NAME LPAREN <params> RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE |

<params> -> <param> | NAME COMMA <params>

<statements> -> <statement> | <statement> <statements>

<statement> -> NAME EQUALS <expression> |         // assignment statement
               <expression> |                     // meant to be a method call that doesn't use returned value

               <forStatement> |

               <ifStatement> |

               RETURN <expression> |              // can return a value or just return
               RETURN

<forStatement> -> FOR LPAREN NAME = <expression> SEMICOLON <expression> SEMICOLON NAME = <expression> RPAREN LBRACE 
                       <statements> RBRACE

<ifStatement> -> IF LPAREN <expression> RPAREN LBRACE RBRACE |
                 IF LPAREN <expression> RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE |
                 IF LPAREN <expression> RPAREN LBRACE RBRACE ELSE LBRACE RBRACE ||
                 IF LPAREN <expression> RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE ELSE LBRACE RBRACE ||
                 IF LPAREN <expression> RPAREN LBRACE <statements> RBRACE ELSE LBRACE <statements> RBRACE

<expression> -> NAME | STR | NUM | NULL | THIS | <call>
   
<call> -> <caller> DOT NAME LPAREN RPAREN |
          <caller> DOT NAME LPAREN <args> RPAREN |
          NAME LPAREN RPAREN |                        // in some contexts don't need to have anything before the .
          NAME LPAREN <args> RPAREN |                 // so don't need the dot
          NEW CLASSNAME LPAREN RPAREN |
          NEW CLASSNAME LPAREN <args> RPAREN

<caller> -> NAME |     // calling entity can be a variable holding a reference to an object
            CLASSNAME  // or a class

<args> -> <expression> | <expression> , <args>

Lexical Phase
-------------------------------------

In the CFG, we represent different kinds of tokens by
all uppercase letters.

Some tokens are keywords:
-------------------------
CLASS is the keyword "class"
STATIC is the keyword "static"
FOR is the keyword "for"
RETURN is the keyword "return"
IF is the keyword "if"
ELSE is the keyword "else"
NEW is the keyword "new"
VOID is the keyword "void"
NULL is the keyword "null"
THIS is the keyword "this"
TRUE is the keyword "true"
FALSE is the keyword "false"

Some tokens are single symbols:
------------------------------
LBRACE is the single symbol "{"
RBRACE is the single symbol "}"
LPAREN is the single symbol "("
RPAREN is the single symbol ")"
EQUALS is the single symbol "="
COMMA is the single symbol ","
SEMICOLON is the single symbol ";"
DOT is the single symbol "."

Some tokens can be longer:
--------------------------
NAME starts with a lowercase letter followed by zero or more letters or digits, intended to be a "variable"
CLASSNAME starts with an uppercase letter followed by zero or more letters or digits, intended to be the name of a class
STRING is most ordinary symbols in between " symbols, like "hello", and also can have
            a backslash followed by exactly 3 digits giving a symbol number in decimal,
             like \013 for return, \097 for 'a' 
NUM is an optional - symbol followed by 1 or more digits followed by a '.' followed by 0 or more digits
 (note that there is not separate integer type)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Semantics (Meaning) and Related Implementation Ideas
---------

A lot of the functionality in a typical language will be provided through a number of predefined
classes:

Num --- a Num instance is a numeric value
             There is no distinct integer-only class, so various methods will provide whatever is really needed,
             like round() and trunc() and idiv (integer division) and rem (integer remainder),
             in addition to a bunch of real-number methods like sqrt, sin, ...

Str --- a Str instance is very much like a Java String

Bool --- has only two instances, with corresponding literals true and false

Lst ---  a list, provides functionality missing because there are no arrays!

Types of variables are determined by the type of object (class instance) whose reference is stored in the variable

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pragmatics
----------

For simplicity, we will put all the classes for a Frappe application in one file (we had discussed earlier doing
it like Java, where the compiler discovers all the class files it needs, but for now we won't bother).

And, to run Frappe on a program, say named "test3", we will do

java Frappe test3 Fish main

where "Fish" is the name of a class in the file "test3" and "main" is the name of 
a static method in that class that takes no input arguments, and is the starting
point of execution (except that in Frappe the first thing that needs to happen is initialization of
all the static variables).
